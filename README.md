# IoT_Temp-Humid-Sensor 
An IoT Temperature and Humidity Sensor Project in the summer course '24 "Introduction to Applied IoT" at Linnaeus University.

Name and student credentials: *Darina Larsen, dl222sg*


## **Overview**
In this project I chose to make a temperature and humidity sensor using the MCU Raspberry Pico Pi WH and the temperature sensor DH11 by connecting them on a breadboard and then programming their behaviour with Micropython language on Thonny. The idea of the project is to also be able to see the output on a website by connecting the MCU wirelessly to WiFi.

The estimation of the time required to complete this project is approximately a week (taking research, setup, coding etc. into consideration)


## **Objective**

The reason I chose this project is because I will spend the majority of the summer working while leaving my pet at home alone, and I would like to be able to see the alterations in temperature and humidity in the apartment. I already have an AC and a fan that I can turn on and off through an app, and by seeing the data provided through this project, I can have a better understanding for when I should turn them on or off remotely. In this way I can avoid letting my pet either freeze or be warm by guessing what alternative is better.
